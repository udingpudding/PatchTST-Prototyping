# Patch-TST for Time-Series Demand Forecasting 📊

## Background
My firm is building an ensemble of models for front-store demand forecasting. The goal was to prototype a transformer-based model, Patch-TST, to address slow training speeds and poor performance on seasonal data, issues seen in the existing transformer-based model. The model was tested against TFT to assess training speed, overall performance, and seasonal data handling.

## Project Goals 🎯
- **Faster Training Speeds** than TFT
- **Par Overall Performance** to TFT
- **Better Performance on Seasonal Data** 🌱

## Model Choice: Patch-TST 🧩
Patch-TST is designed to address traditional transformer limitations for time-series tasks:
- **Patching of Input Time-Series**: Sequential time-steps are grouped into patches, reducing time complexity and enabling larger lookback windows for better seasonal data handling.
- **Channel Independence**: Each time-series is processed independently, which benefits unrelated sales trends in different product categories.

## Model Development 🛠️
- **Libraries/Tools**: Developed using the TSAI library with FastAI for preprocessing. Optuna was used for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Dataset**: Oral Hygiene (Adversion B) was used for training and benchmarking against TFT.
- **Forecasting Horizon**: Matched TFT’s for consistency.

## Model Limitations ⚠️
1. **Exogenous Variables**: Patch-TST doesn’t support exogenous variables, limiting the feature set to auto-correlation only.
2. **Library Limitations**: TSAI library's limited documentation and lack of support for custom loss functions restricted testing.

## Model Results 📊
Despite faster training times, the model's performance was below expectations:
- **PatchTST Oral Hygiene**: Rolling SMAPE of 60%, with a training time of 90 seconds per epoch.
- **TFT Oral Hygiene**: Rolling SMAPE of 37%, with a training time of >2 hours per total run.

## Explanation of Limitations 🧐
1. **Autocorrelation Assumption**: The absence of exogenous variables led to a significant loss of predictive power.
2. **High Model Complexity**: The large number of parameters required and reduced input tokens due to patching led to overfitting and unstable training.
3. **Isolation of Input Time-Series**: Channel independence caused the model to ignore inter-relationships between time-series, reducing its predictive accuracy compared to TFT.

## Going Forward 🚀
1. **Change Data Granularity**: Switching to daily data granularity may provide more data for better training.
2. **Custom Loss Function**: Implementing SMAPE or weighted SMAPE could improve performance.
3. **Library Improvements**: Future updates to TSAI or adoption of other libraries could enable better handling of loss functions and model tuning.

## Project Summary 📝
Patch-TST was ruled out as a viable option for the ensemble due to poor performance despite faster training times. Further improvements to TFT and exploration of other advanced time-series forecasting methods like Mamba are recommended.
